# Title
MERN Book Search Engine.

# Description
Fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server. 

# Installation
"npm install" and "npm run develop" for running the application.

# Usage
As an avid reader you want to search for new books to read so that you can keep a list of books to purchase. For this reason this app was developed.

Once the search engine is loaded you can see a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.

Clicking on the Search for Books menu option, it is presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button.

If you are logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button
it is presented several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.

When you click on the Login/Signup menu option a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up.

Selecting the toggle is set to Signup, asking for three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button.

Otherwise the toggle is set to Login, it is presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button.

Entering a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button your user account is created and you are logged in to the site.

When you enter your account’s email address and password and click on the login button, the modal closes and you are logged in to the site. In this moment the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout.

When you are logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button, it is able to get several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to your account.

Clicking on the Save button on a book, that book’s information is saved to your account.

If you want to see your saved books only click on the option. After that it is presented with all of the books you have saved to your account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from your account.

Click on the Remove button on a book, and a book is deleted from your saved books list.
